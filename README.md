# ⏱️ Time Series Stock Price Forecasting Model

This project implements a time series forecasting model to predict future stock prices using historical stock data. The model helps investors and analysts gain insights into potential market trends and make informed decisions.

## 🎯 Project Goals

- Build and evaluate time series forecasting models for stock prices.
- Use historical data to train models and predict future closing prices.
- Visualize both historical trends and predicted values for comparison.
- Experiment with statistical and machine learning models (ARIMA, SARIMA, Prophet, etc.).

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies Used

- **Python** (Core language)
- **Pandas & NumPy** for data manipulation
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** for data visualization
- **Statsmodels** for ARIMA/SARIMA
- **Facebook Prophet** for forecasting
- **YFinance** or CSV data for stock price input
- **Jupyter Notebook** for step-by-step analysis
